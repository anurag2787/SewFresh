# SewFresh

## Project Overview
Relocating to a new area poses challenges in finding trustworthy tailors, often necessitating time-consuming and inconvenient visits to numerous shops. Without digital platforms, individuals lack efficient means to select tailored services, leading to uncertainty in quality and security.

SewFresh connects users with local tailor shops, providing details, reviews, and booking options for a perfect fit. Unlike existing platforms that may focus on specific tailor shops, SewFresh aggregates a wide range of options, ensuring users have multiple choices tailored to their preferences.
